# cmcmarkets
This app aims to solve the challenge posed by CMC markets for the Junior Full Stack Developer role. The app is a small online store that sells cricket equipment. The front-end is is built using React.js and back-end is a .Net 5 Web API which uses an in-memory database.

## Pre-requisites to Run the Project
* .NET 5 SDK and .NET 5 Runtime
* Visual Studio 2019
* Node.js

## Steps to Run the Project
* Download the Project from github.
* Extract the files to a folder.
* In the extracted folders, open the Server folder and look for .sln file and open it.
* Change the startup project to CMCMarketsServer and run the project. This will start the server on localhost:5000

* For the front-end, navigate to cmcmarkets folder from the command line.
* run command "npm install" 
* run command "npm start"
 * If your server is running on a different port than 5000, you will need to change it in the .env file of the react app.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any issues running the app. :)
